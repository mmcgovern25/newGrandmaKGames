        The Grandma K Games were created with a deep love and admiration for the most wonderful grandmother in the world. Our beloved Grandma K has always been the heart of our family, and it’s through her strength and enduring spirit that we find inspiration.

        Although Alzheimer’s disease presents its challenges, we are united in our commitment to support her through every step of this journey. We may not be able to halt the progress of Alzheimer’s, but why not try to slow it down with some meaningful memory games?

        Whenever family members visit Grandma, we hope these games can offer a moment of fun and togetherness, helping her recall the beautiful memories we’ve shared as a family. Our goal is to bring a smile to her face and remind her of the love and happiness that surrounds her.

        Each game is a small token of our love and dedication. We love you, Grandma! Time to find out who the Champeens are in the family!
